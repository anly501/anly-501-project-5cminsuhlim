                        Advocacy for gender equality has taken many different definitions over its many iterations in the U.S. With its beginnings in 1848, first-wave feminism “focused on legal issues, primarily on securing women’s rights to vote.”<sup>1</sup> Then came second-wave feminism in the 1960s, focusing on a broader range of issues, ranging from “sexuality, family, domesticity, the workplace, [and] reproductive rights.”<sup>2</sup> A couple of decades later, in the early 1990s, third-wave feminism entered the mainstream and aimed at “abolishing gender-role stereotypes and expanding feminism to include women with diverse racial and cultural identities.”<sup>3</sup> Most recently, beginning in 2012, fourth-wave feminism gained traction, centered around “gendered norms and the marginalization of women in society,”<sup>4</sup> seeking to encourage women to speak up more about their personal experiences of sexual exploitation and objectification. 

                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Alongside second-wave feminism, during the 1970s, the men’s rights movement began, focusing on “social issues and specific government services… [that] structurally discriminate against men and boys.”<sup>5</sup> This movement has been seen as a countercultural backlash against feminism to put the spotlight on the adverse impacts of divorce laws, child custody, and sentencing disparities experienced by men. Much like feminism, the men’s rights movement has also seen many different iterations with more modern movements such as Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW) and the Red Pill.<sup>6</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Both the feminist movement and men’s rights movement bringing up valid societal and cultural issues that should be further inspected, and at face value, these issues can and should be addressed by both genders together. However, as of more recently, both “radical feminists and men in the Men’s Rights Movement… have chosen not to associate with the opposite gender.”<sup>7</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The divide occurring between men and women in society may already be reflected in multiple outlets.

                <div class="col-lg-8">

                        One potential societal effect of such a gender divide could be the declining marriage rate, as shown on the figure on the right.

                        In order to shed more light on this current issue, I hope to analyze gender equality through three main categories: educational, occupational, and societal. I will also present other potential confounding variables at the end of the analyses to add the much deserved nuance to such a complex and controversial topic. Questions that I will directly tackle through data analysis are in bold, while questions I will refer to existent research are in regular text.
