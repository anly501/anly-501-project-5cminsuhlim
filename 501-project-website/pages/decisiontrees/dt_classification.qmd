# Classification with Decision Trees

## Methods

Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. As the name suggests, DTs creates a tree-like structure consisting of decisions in the form of conditional (if) statements and their respective resulting consequences. DTs are conceptually similar to a flowchart, where each node of the tree represents a "Yes" or "No" test on a particular attribute, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a particular class to which a particular item would most likely belong.

![Xoriant / "Decision Trees for Classification: A Machine Learning Algorithm"](./dt_classification_files/figure-html/dt_example.png)

For example, the above image is an example of a very elementary DT to decide (or classify) whether or not a person is fit. At the very top node (the root node), we typically have a question that can split the data set as "efficiently" as possible (although the metric for efficiency will differ based on the criterion). In this case, we first ask if a person is less than 30 years old. If so, we then ask if this person eats a lot of pizzas. If the answer is yes, then we'd conclude that this person is unfit; if the answer is no, we'd conclude that this person is fit. However, if this person is older than 30 years old, we ask if this person exercises in the morning. If the answer is yes, then we conclude that the person is fit; otherwise, we conclude that the person is unfit. 

As per the example, simply asking a person's age, frequency of pizza consumption, and exercise habits is probably insufficient to truly decide if a person is fit. This is a simplistic workflow, but the algorithms used by the DTs search for good tree rules that attempts to best classify the given dataset. However, finding the optimal tree is very difficult due to the infinite number of possible decision trees that can be constructed given the attributes of a data set. As such, DTs can be a good, computationally cheap starting point to find interesting trends within the data, which can later be further explored with more detailed and computationally expensive methods. 

For our analysis below, we will be using the Bureau of Labor Statistics' wages by occupation data set. We will attempt to classify which job type (e.g. Managerial, Legal, Business) an occupation falls under given the occupation's total employment, mean annual wage, employment percent standard relative error, and mean annual wage percent standard relative error.

### Imports

```{python}
import sklearn
from sklearn import datasets
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score
from sklearn.metrics import recall_score
```

### Load Data

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('../../../data/01-modified-data/occupations_detailed_(employment_and_wage).csv')

## drop unneeded column created from read_csv
df = df.iloc[:, 1:]
```

### Separate Predictor and Response Variables

```{python}
# Y="Target" COLUMN and X="everything else"
X = df.iloc[:, 2:6]
Y = df.iloc[:, 7]
```

### Normalization

Since our predictors (X) consist of employment rates and mean annual wages, we first normalize our data to bring all the predictor values into a space that is unitless. This transformation of data brings everything to a similar scale, which makes it easier for the DT algorithm to "learn" the data. 

```{python}
X=0.1+(X-np.min(X,axis=0))/(np.max(X,axis=0)-np.min(X,axis=0))
```

## Class Distribution

### Numerical EDA

As shown in the output below, our target class is heavily imbalanced. Since this imbalance can skew the way the data is split into training and test sets, we will later stratify the data so the proportion of values in the training and test sets also reflect this imbalance.

```{python}
df['Target'].value_counts(ascending=True)
```

### Multivariable Pair Plot

As mentioned before, the distributions of the target class is heavily imbalanced. Again, we can see this visually represented in the density plots in the correlation multivariable pair plot below. 

```{python}
sns.pairplot(df.iloc[:, 2:7], hue='Target')
plt.show()
```

## Baseline: Random Classifier

In order to have some baseline to compare our DT's performance, we defined a random classifier below.

### Define Random Classifier Function
```{python}
from collections import Counter
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_fscore_support
def random_classifier(y_data):
    ypred=[];
    max_label=np.max(y_data); #print(max_label)
    for i in range(0,len(y_data)):
        ypred.append(int(np.floor((max_label+1)*np.random.uniform(0,1))))

    print("-----RANDOM CLASSIFIER-----")
    print("count of prediction:",Counter(ypred).values()) # counts the elements' frequency
    print("probability of prediction:",np.fromiter(Counter(ypred).values(), dtype=float)/len(y_data)) # counts the elements' frequency
    print("accuracy",accuracy_score(y_data, ypred))
    print("precision, recall, fscore,",precision_recall_fscore_support(y_data, ypred))
random_classifier(Y)
```

Based on the output above, we can see that accuracy of the random classifier is 0.04, which is around what we'd expect from randomly taking guesses for 22 target classes. We can also see that the precision, recall, and f-scores from the random classifier are all below 0.1. 

## Feature Selection

### Correlation

The correlation output below shows a strong positive correlation (> 0.8) between employment percent relative standard error (EMP_PRSE) and mean annual salary percent relative standard error (MEAN_PRSE). Since we need to maintain independence among the predictor variables, I will drop employment percent relative standard error (EMP_PRSE) to prevent the model from overcounting similar features.

```{python}
corr = X.corr()
print(corr)	
```

### Correlation Matrix Heatmap

The correlation matrix heatmap below reflects the previous correlation output. Again, there is a strong positive correlation between employment percent relative standard error (EMP_PRSE) and mean annual salary percent relative standard error (MEAN_PRSE).

```{python}
sns.set_theme(style="white")
f, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(11, 9))  # Set up the matplotlib figure
cmap = sns.diverging_palette(230, 20, as_cmap=True) 	# Generate a custom diverging colormap
# Draw the heatmap with the mask and correct aspect ratio
sns.heatmap(corr,  cmap=cmap, vmin=-1, vmax=1, center=0,
        square=True, linewidths=.5, cbar_kws={"shrink": .5})
plt.show();
```

### Remove Correlated Features

```{python}
X.drop(columns=['EMP_PRSE'], inplace=True)
```

### Split Data

```{python}
# PARTITION THE DATASET INTO TRAINING AND TEST SETS
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
test_ratio=0.2
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=test_ratio, random_state=0, stratify=Y)
```

## Training the Model w/ Default Parameters

```{python}
# TRAIN A SKLEARN DECISION TREE MODEL ON x_train,y_train 
from sklearn import tree
model = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()
model = model.fit(x_train, y_train)
```

### Check the Results

```{python}
# USE THE MODEL TO MAKE PREDICTIONS FOR THE TRAINING AND TEST SET 
yp_train = model.predict(x_train)
yp_test = model.predict(x_test)
```

```{python}
# GENERATES A CONFUSION MATRIX PLOT AND PRINTS MODEL PERFORMANCE METRICS
def confusion_plot(y_data, y_pred):    
    cm = confusion_matrix(y_data, y_pred)
    disp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=cm)
    disp.plot()
    
    print('ACCURACY:', accuracy_score(y_data, y_pred))
    print('RECALL:', recall_score(y_data, y_pred, average='weighted'))
    print('PRECISION:', precision_score(y_data, y_pred, average='weighted'))
    
    plt.show()


from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay
```

```{python}
print("------TRAINING------")
confusion_plot(y_train,yp_train)
print("------TEST------")
confusion_plot(y_test,yp_test)
```

As shown in the correlation matrices above for both the training and test data sets, we can see that the DT resulted in a perfect fit for the training set but a much less adequate fit for the test set. Such a drastic difference in the accuracy, recall, and precision scores between the training and test sets suggest significant overfitting of the model (which is a notable characteristic of DTs). 

### Visualize the Tree

```{python}
# VISUALIZE THE DECISION TREE
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn import tree

regr = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=1234)
model = regr.fit(x_train, y_train)

def plot_tree(model, X, Y):
    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(25,20))
    _ = tree.plot_tree(model, 
                    feature_names=X.columns,  
                    class_names=Y.name,
                    filled=True)
```

```{python}
plot_tree(model, X, Y)
```

## Model Tuning

As mentioned previously, the model with default parameters resulted in a heavily overfit DT. In order to find a more well-rounded model, we will perform model tuning.

### Hyperparameter Tuning

First, we loop over possible hyperparameter values, ranging from 1 to 50, keeping track of the training and test sets' accuracy and recall scores for each hyperparameter value. We then create plots for accuracy and recall scores for the training and test sets to identify which number of layers for the DT would result in an optimal model. 

```{python}
# LOOP OVER POSSIBLE HYPER-PARAMETERS VALUES
test_results=[]
train_results=[]

for num_layer in range(1,51):
    model = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=num_layer)
    model = model.fit(x_train, y_train)

    yp_train=model.predict(x_train)
    yp_test=model.predict(x_test)

    # print(y_pred.shape)
    test_results.append([num_layer,accuracy_score(y_test, yp_test),recall_score(y_test, yp_test, average='weighted')])
    train_results.append([num_layer,accuracy_score(y_train, yp_train),recall_score(y_train, yp_train, average='weighted')])
```

```{python}
layers = [el[0] for el in test_results]
          
test_acc = [el[1] for el in test_results]
test_rec = [el[2] for el in test_results]

train_acc = [el[1] for el in train_results]
train_rec = [el[2] for el in train_results]
```

### Find Optimal Hyperparameter

Based on the plots below, we can narrow down the best hyperparameter value for our model as somewhere between 2-4, since both accuracy and recall scores begin to diverge more and more dramatically beginning from max_depth=5. To avoid our original default model's issue of overfitting, we will proceed with our optimal hyperparameter value of max_depth=4. 

```{python}
# GENERATE PLOTS TO IDENTIFY OPTIMAL HYPERPARAMETER
def gen_plots(x, train, test):
    plt.plot(x,train, c='b')
    plt.scatter(x,train,c='b')
    plt.plot(x,test,c='r')
    plt.scatter(x,test,c='r')
    plt.xlabel("Number of layers in decision tree (max_depth)")
    plt.show();

plt.ylabel("ACCURACY: Training (blue) and Test (red)")
gen_plots(layers, train_acc, test_acc)
plt.ylabel("RECALL: Training (blue) and Test (red)")
gen_plots(layers, train_rec, test_rec)
```

To numerically validate our intuition from the previous graphs, we can once again see from the output below that hyperparameter values 1-4 have training and test mean absolute errors that are relatively similar. However, from value 5, we can see that the difference between the two mean absolute errors begins to grow rather rapidly. As such, we can confirm our prior intution and proceed with max_depth=4 as our optimal hyperparameter value.

```{python}
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_percentage_error
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
hyper_param=[]
train_error=[]
test_error=[]
for i in range(1,23):
    # INITIALIZE MODEL 
    model = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=i)

    # TRAIN MODEL 
    model.fit(x_train,y_train)

    # OUTPUT PREDICTIONS FOR TRAINING AND TEST SET 
    yp_train = model.predict(x_train)
    yp_test = model.predict(x_test)

    # GET MAE
    err1=mean_absolute_error(y_train, yp_train) 
    err2=mean_absolute_error(y_test, yp_test) 

    hyper_param.append(i)
    train_error.append(err1)
    test_error.append(err2)

    print("hyperparam =",i)
    print(" train error:",err1)
    print(" test error:" ,err2)
    print(" error diff:" ,abs(err2-err1))
```

## Final Results

### Train Optimal Model

```{python}
#### TRAIN A SKLEARN DECISION TREE MODEL ON x_train,y_train 
from sklearn import tree
model = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=4)
model = model.fit(x_train, y_train)

yp_train=model.predict(x_train)
yp_test=model.predict(x_test)
```

```{python}
print("------TRAINING------")
confusion_plot(y_train,yp_train)
print("------TEST------")
confusion_plot(y_test,yp_test)
```

The confusion matrices above show a large decrease in the accuracy, recall, and precision scores for both the training and test sets compared to the metrics from our original model with default parameters; however, we are now no longer overfitting. While accuracy, recall, and precision scores less than 0.3 seem quite small, our optimized model outperforms the random classifier by 6-7 times, which is quite a large improvement from classifying completely randomly. Nonetheless, the model can definitely see some improvements. Most notably, having more predictor variables with which the classifier could work may help fine-tune the classifier even more. Additionally, obtaining more data to create a balanced target class may also help with the classifier's performance.
