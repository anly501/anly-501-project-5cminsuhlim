                    Prior to diving into the details of the data, it's important to understand what the Big Five Personality traits are. <strong>Openness</strong> relates to imagination, insight, creativity, and curiousity. <strong>Conscientiousness</strong> relates to thoughtfulness, self-control, attention to detail, and orderliness. <strong>Extraversion</strong> relates to sociability, assertiveness, and excitability. <strong>Agreeableness</strong> relates to prosocial behaviors, such as empathy, altruism, and affection. <strong>Neuroticism</strong> relates to anxiety, low stress tolerance, and emotional instability.<sup>1</sup>

                        On the left is the summary statistics output. Based on the case_id count, we can see that there is Big Five Personality data for 212,625 individuals from the U.S. Based on the age column, we can see that the youngest and oldest individuals who have taken this assessment are 10 and 99 years old, but the general age of these individuals hovers from around 18 to 29 years old. Since sex is labeled numerically in this data, with 1 = Men and 2 = Women, the mean sex of 1.6 shows that there are more women than men in this dataset. Additionally, it should be noted that the scoring of each personality category is on a scale of 0 to 1, where 0 is low association and 1 is high association with a particular category.

                        Observing the graphical and numerical correlation matrices on the right, we can see that there is a weak positive correlation with age and conscientiousness. There is also a weak positive correlation with sex and agreeableness. Among the traits themselves, there is a weak positive correlation between agreeableness and conscientiousness, as well as a moderate negative correlation among neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness.

                        Observing the Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctor's degrees earned in 2018-2019, the bar graph on the right shows once again that women pursuit higher education at a greater frequency than men.

                        The image below shows the distribution of Bachelor's degrees given to men and women across various fields of study in 2019-2020 with the fields of study arranged in descending order according to female representation (except the top most bar, which is the total representation across all fields). We can see from the bar graph that there is a noticeable contrast in the fields of study men and women pursuit. For example, women seem to make up the majority in the social sciences, liberal arts, and humanities (except for fields such as Biology), while men seem to make up the majority in STEM and manual labor fields (except for fields such as Theology and Philosophy).

                        Observing bar graph on the right, we can see that for people above 25 years old in 2021 the median weekly earnings (USD) increased at their level of educational attainment increased.

                        The inverse observation can be seen with the unemployment rate, which shows a lower unemployment rate for those achieving higher levels of education.

                        Additionally, the figure on the right shows the most polarized (i.e. one sex having double or more employment in) occupations for people above 16 years old in 2021. Based on the listed occupations, we can see that fields dominated by men tend to be physical / manual labor or dealing with objects, while fields dominated by women tend to relate to service and interacting with people.

                        The line graph on the left shows employment rates for men and women across various age groups in the U.S. from 1948 to 2022. From this figure, we can see that over the span of nearly eight decades, the employment rate of men has been slowly declining while women's employment rate has been drastically rising. However, other than the 16-24 age bracket, there still is quite noticeable disparities in male and female employment.

                        The bar graph on the right shows the number of workers (in thousands) in various fields by sex in 2021. This is further categorized based on those who work &lt;35 hours and those who work 35+ hours. When observing just the number of people at work, we can once again see that women tend to dominate fields that engage with people, while men tend to dominate fields that involve manual labor and handling objects. This trend is consistent even across those working &lt;35 hours and those who work 35+ hours, with the only exception being Management/Professional occupations.

                        The bar graph on the left shows the number of hours worked in various fields by sex in 2021 and is further specified to only full-time workers. In both cases, men tend to work anywhere from 0.8 to 4.1 more hours than women.

                        The bar graph on the right shows the mean annual wage (USD) in various fields in May 2021. From this graph, we can see that the top three highest paying jobs as of May 2021 were:
                        <ol type="1">
                            <li>Management</li>
                            <li>Legal</li>
                            <li>Computer and Mathematical</li>
                        </ol>
                        Similarly, the three lowest paying jobs were:
                        <ol type="1">
                            <li>Food Preparation and Serving Related</li>

                        </ol>
                        Upon closer inspection, we can see that STEM and business-related made up higher paying jobs, while the lower paying end consisted of service and manual labor jobs.

                        The line graphs on the left shows various forms of female representation in the U.S. government from 1965 to 2021. We can see from the graphs that female representation in the U.S. government has been steadily increasing over the past six decades, but it should also be noted that women only make up 18% of state governors, 27.3% of U.S. representatives, 26% of senators, and 30.8% of state legislators.

We can see from the graph that from 1940 to around 2010 there was a greater proportion of college degree holders among men than among women.

                        Based on the Twitter API call for multiple keywords associated with both the women's and men's rights movements, we generated the wordcloud on the left.
