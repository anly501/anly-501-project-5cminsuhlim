                        Various data sets relating to employment rate in the U.S. from 1948 to 2022 were collected using the BLS API and associated data series codes.

The sexes are distinguished by the associated series codes LNS12300164 for men and LNS12300327 for women. The other employment rate data sets that were gathered also follow a similar pattern of year, period, periodName, footnotes, associated series codes, and date.

                        In the image above, I took 10 instances from the BFP. The scores for each of the five personality categories are on a 0-1 scale, where 0 indicates a low tendency and 1 indicates a high tendency towards a specific trait. Additionally, the coding for sex is 1 for males and 2 for females. Using the first item as an example, the individual of case_id 1 would be a male showing relatively high agreeableness, openness, and conscientiousness, while having relatively average extraversion and neuroticism. To accurately restrict the scope to just the U.S. population, I will subset the data in the next <a href="./datacleaning.html">Data Cleaning</a> section.

                        While we have a fair amount of hard data regarding multiple facets for measuring gender equality in the U.S., we lack information on the public sentiment towards this topic. To gain better insight into how the general population views gender equality in the U.S., we will gather Tweets via the Twitter API for specific keywords often used within the feminist and men's rights spheres. The keywords used in the Twitter API call were wage gap, earnings gap, feminism, men's rights, women's rights, and MGTOW.
