                        Random Forests (RFs) are an ensemble learning method used for classification and regression. As the name suggests, RFs are composed of multiple decision trees. The algorithm works based on the "consensus of the masses" by creating a forest of uncorrelated decision trees that consider only a select subset of features, which is a notable difference from decision trees, which considers all possible feature splits. As such, the output from RFs is the class selected by the majority of the individual decision trees.

                        For example, the above image is an example of the RF classification process. From the dataset, multiple decision trees (hence "forest") are generated, with each individual tree spitting out a classification result. Then the individual results from each tree are gathered, and a majority vote is conducted to decide on the final result (hence "consensus of the masses"). Since RFs are the consensus vote of multiple decision trees, we'd also generally expect the RF classification and regression results to outperform a single decision tree.

                    <p>
                        Below is a classification application of RFs, which attempts to determine a job type based on its employment and wage metrics.

                <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Our RF model, given a job type's employment and wage metrics, can classify the associated job type with an accuracy of 0.31. Based on the RF classification results, we can see that our optimized model outperforms the random classifier by about 8 times (accuracy=0.04 vs. accuracy=0.31), which is quite a large improvement from classifying completely randomly. Additionally, our RF classification model also outperforms the results from our <a target="_blank" href="../decisiontrees/decisiontrees.html">decision tree</a> classification results (accuracy=0.31 vs. accuracy=0.28). This result is to be expected,since RFs are composed of multiple decision trees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nonetheless, the model can definitely see some improvements. Most notably, RFs, since they're composed of decision trees, also suffer from similar shortcomings, such as poor performance on unbalanced data sets. As such, obtaining more data to create a balanced data set may improve the classifier's performance. Additionally, having more predictor variables with which the classifier could work may generally help fine-tune the classifier further.
