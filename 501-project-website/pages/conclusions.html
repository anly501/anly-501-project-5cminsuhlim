            <h1 class="text-center">Conclusions</h1>
            <div class="row">
                <p>This project had the objective of analyzing various metrics of gender equality in the U.S. Our numerous model analyses revealed some interesting findings.</p>

                <p>First, our Naive Bayes analyses revealed that Big Five Personality data can be somewhat predictive of an individual's sex, which suggests that there may be personality differences between men and women, but the magnitude of such differences may not be very large. Additionally, our WikiCrawl data analysis performed quite well, suggesting that there are commonly used words in certain sentence contexts that appear in Wikipedia pages related to "Women's Rights" or "Men's Rights" frequently.</p>

                <p>Second, our Decision Tree and Random Forest analyses revealed that an occupation type can be classified based on employment and wage metrics. We also found that our Decision Tree Regression can determine the average number of hours worked by an employee based on the employee's sex, job type, and the number of employees who work 35+ hours per week in the respective field. However, for both the regression and classification, we suffered from an imbalanced data set, as well as insufficient sample size.</p>

                <p>Third, our Support Vector Machines showed, once again, that the WikiCrawl data could classify certain words used in specific sentence contexts to Wikipedia pages related to "Women's Rights" or "Men's Rights." However, the SVM linear kernel (which was our most optimal model) still underperformed compared to our Naive Bayes analysis. We could achieve potentially better results by gathering attempting more crawls with varying number of pages and sentences.</p>

                <p>Fourth, our Clustering models failed to accurate create optimal cluster predictions for the broad occupation types we had in our data set; however, despite the seemingly unfruitful results, we did see that the models created 3 or 4 clusters, which suggests that there are largely 3 or 4 major industries under which most occupations fall.</p>

                <p>Finally, our Association Rule Mining of the WikiCrawl data revealed that Wikipedia pages relating to "Women's Rights" appeared to have more consistency, since most of the associations found dealt with women's rights, women's equality, and women's violence. Additionally, the word male only appeared in relation to the word woman.x</p>

                <p>In addition to our model analyses, we can come to a couple of conclusions regarding the 12 different questions posed in our Introduction below:</p>

                <h3>Educational</h3>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li class="questions">What is the highest education level earned among men and women?</li>

                    <p>
                        Based on data from the Census Bureau, the percentage of college degree holders in the U.S. from the 1940s to 2021 reflects great strides in women's higher education. Despite the greater proportion of college degree holders consisting of men in the 1940s, this trend began to equalize in 2014, and after 2014, more women have been graduating with degrees from college. This finding is also supported by data from the National Center for Education Statistics, which shows that women made up a greater proportion for Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctor's degree earners.
                    </p>

                    <li class="questions">How is the college population distributed among the sexes?</li>

                    <p>
                        Similarly, based on the Census Bureau's educational attainment data from 1940-2021, we can see women, across all age groups, achieving higher levels of education that men.
                    </p>

                    <li class="questions">What are the wages associated with each level of education?</li>

                    <p>
                        Based on 2021 earnings data for 25 year olds from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there's a very strong correlation between increasing levels of education and an increase in income. Additionally, there's an inverse relationship between increasing levels of education and unemployment rate. Also, the occupations with the highest mean annual wage, as of May 2021, were in Management, Legal, and Computer/Maths, while the lowest pay jobs were all in the service industry.
                    </p>

                    <li class="questions">For what fields do men and women tend to get degrees?</li>

                    <p>
                        Based on 2019-2020 data from the National Center for Education Statistics, men tend to make up the majority of STEM and labor fields, while women tend to dominate the social sciences, liberal arts.
                    </p>
                </ol>

                <h3>Occupational</h3>
                <ol start="5">
                    <li class="questions">What occupations are men and women more likely to enter?</li>

                    <p>
                        Based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics data on occupations by sex, the most polarized (i.e. one sex having double or more employment in) occupations for people above the age of 16 in 2021 reveal that men dominate labor and engineering-related professional jobs, while women dominate service and healthcare-related professional jobs.
                    </p>

                    <li class="questions">What are the wages associated with occupational fields?</li>

                    <p>
                        From our Clustering analysis on employment and wage based on occupation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we came to the conclusion that there are largely 3 or 4 major industries that most occupations fall under, specifically Service, Labor, Professional, and Arts. Upon closer inspection of the data set itself, we can see that Service has an annual mean wage of about $54,000, Labor has an annual mean wage of about $50,000, Engineering has an annual mean wage of about $107,000, and Arts has an annual wage of around $67,000.
                    </p>

                    <li class="questions">How do men and women’s labor force participation differ?</li>

                    <p>
                        Much like the trends seen in the fields that men and women tend to obtain college degrees in, employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that in 2021, men tended towards fields that involve manual labor, while women leaned towards service occupations. Interestingly, slightly more women seem to occupy the managerial and professional fields than men when looking at the entire working population; however, this trend is reversed when we look at people who work more than 35 hours per week.
                    </p>

                    <li class="questions">How many hours are worked by men and women?</li>
                    <p>
                        Relating to the last question's answer, we also see that the average hours worked by all workers, as well as specifically full-time workers, was anywhere from 0.8 to 4.1 hours greater for men than women across all occupations. 
                    </p>
                </ol>

                <h3>Societal</h3>
                <ol start="9">
                    <li class="questions">Are men and women equally represented in government?</li>

                    <p>
                        Using data from the Center for American Women and Politics, we can see a relatively consistent increasing trend for female representation in varying U.S. government positions from 1965-2021. Nonetheless, as of 2021, women only made up 18% of state governors, 27.3% of U.S. representatives, 26% of senators, and 30.8% of state legislators.
                    </p>

                    <li class="questionsref">Are men and women sentenced equally under the law in court?</li>

                    <p>
                        There seems to be a decent consensus on this subject. In a 1987 journal by Johnston et. al. from the U.S. Department of Justice, they concluded that there appears to be "moderate differences in the treatment of males and females in the criminal justice system," where women, compared to men, "were accorded leniency in charge bargaining, prison confinement, and sentence length" all while controlling for confounding variables, such as "control for prior record, seriousness of conviction offense, and characteristics surrounding the offense." However, it was also noted that men and women were more likely to get longer sentences that the opposite sex if their behavior violated sex-role stereotypes. For example, women received longer sentences for robbery and assault than men, while men were incarcerated at higher rates for property crime.<sup>1</sup> 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Another 2007 study by Sarnikar et al. revealed similar findings, where women received prison sentences that were "a little over 2 years less than those awarded to men." Additionally, after controlling for confounding variables "such as the severity of the offense and past criminal history, women receive[d] more lenient sentences" by about 9.5 months. An important nuance mentioned by this paper, however, is that sentencing disparities appear to increase when considering the entire process of discretionary decision making, charges, and sentencing.<sup>2</sup> However, a more recent 2015 paper by Starr, which accounted for this issue, found that men receive sentences that are still, on average, 63% longer than women.<sup>3</sup>
                    </p>
                </ol>

                <h3>Potential Confounding Variables</h3>
                <ol start="11">
                    <li class="questions">How do men and women differ in their temperament based on the Big Five Personality Traits?</li>

                    <p>
                        Based on our Naive Bayes analysis on Big Five Personality data, we found that our model was able to classify individuals into either male or female based on their scores across the Big Five personality traits with an accuracy of about 68%, which is a slightly better than random guesses (which would be 50%). This seems to suggest that men and women do differ in their temperament, but the magnitude of this difference may be moderate at best.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This finding is supported by the psychology literature as well. A 2011 study by Weisberg et al. also concluded that there were significant gender differences across the Big Five personality traits; however, the mean differences of the gender differences in personality appeared to be small to moderate, with much of "the distributions of traits for men and women... largely overlapping."<sup>4</sup> This is corroborated by the marginal probability plots that we observed as well, where the distributions for men and women across all the personality traits largely overlapped.
                    </p>

                    <li class="questionsref">How do the IQ distributions of men and women differ?</li>

                    <p>
                        The literature regarding this subject appears to be relatively consistent since the early 20th century. A 1932 study by Deary et al. on 80,000+ Scottish 11 year olds revealed that the mean IQ scores for boys and girls were essentially the same (with 100.64 for girls and 100.48 for boys). However, the notable finding was that the standard deviation among girls was 14.1 and among boys was 14.9, which was a statistically significant (p &lt 0.001) difference in variances.<sup>5</sup> 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        This finding was later corroborated in a 2006 study by Strand et al. on 320,000 11-12 year olds in the U.K. This study similarly found that the mean differences in IQ testing metrics of verbal reasoning, non-verbal reasoning, and quantitative reasoning were small enough to be negligible. However, across all tests, "there were substantial sex differences in the standard deviation of scores, with greater variance among boys" with boys over representing "both the top and bottom extremes for all tests."<sup>6</sup>
